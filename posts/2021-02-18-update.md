# Back at it again

## What I've been up to lately
Around the end of September of last year, I left LA and moved back to Philly. Not too surprisingly, I was not extremely focussed on maintaining a blog / personal website. But now that I've gotten a nice couch and had a chance to show my dog what snow looks like, I think I'm going to working on personal projects again. 

## Plan for the site
Initially I thought I might scrap this site and rewrite it using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), since most of the content would be static. After spending a bunch of time trying to get it downloaded / configured, I realized that there wasn't a good way to tack on an api to Hakyll for delivering non-static content. I want to have a little bit of flexibility here because at some point I think I might want to allow for some more dynamic content in the posts. I'd like to have this be sort of a living portfolio of whatever I happen to be working on in my spare time, which would likely mean some interactivity beyond what a static site generator could handle. Besides I've already built this thing, so why not just use it. All that being said, Hakyll seems like a really nice tool for static site generation, and it's also possible that I'm just misunderstanding what it's capable of.

## Some updates to the site
As mentioned in my previous post, the routing for this site was kind of ugly and hard to follow:

``` haskell
app :: TVar BlogPosts -> Application
app tPosts request respond = do 
  posts <- readTVarIO tPosts
  let getBlog = htmlRoute . blog posts
  respond $ 
    case toString $ rawPathInfo request of
      str
        | str == "/" -> getBlog (fst $ head $ Map.toDescList posts)
        | str == "/posts" -> htmlRoute $ blogs posts
        | take 7 str == "/posts/" 
            && Map.member (BlogKey $ drop 7 $ str) posts 
                -> getBlog $ BlogKey $ drop 7 str
        | str == "/css/style.css" -> css
        | otherwise -> notFound

...

htmlRoute :: Html -> Response 
htmlRoute h = responseLBS
  status200
  [("Content-Type", "text/html")]
  (renderMarkup h)

css :: Response
css = responseFile
  status200
  [("Content-Type", "text/css")]
  "./css/style.css"
  Nothing

notFound :: Response 
notFound = responseLBS
  status404
  [("Content-Type", "text/html")]
  (renderMarkup notFoundPage)
```

Maybe not the worst looking thing in the world, but as I add more routes, I think it will get more confusing.

Here's the updated version:

``` haskell
routing :: TVar BlogPosts -> ScottyM ()
routing tPosts = do 
  -- Include css, js, etc
  middleware $ staticPolicy (noDots >-> addBase "static")
  
  -- Root loads most recent post
  get "/" $ do 
    posts <- getPosts
    let postKey = fst $ head $ Map.toDescList posts
    blogResponse postKey posts

  -- List of blog posts 
  get "/posts" $ getPosts >>= htmlResponse . blogs

  -- Load a specific blog post 
  get "/:post" $ do 
    posts <- getPosts
    post  <- BlogKey <$> param "post"
    if Map.member post posts then 
      blogResponse post posts
    else 
      next 
  
  -- 404
  notFound $ htmlResponse notFoundPage

  where getPosts = liftIO (readTVarIO tPosts)
        htmlResponse = html . renderHtml
        blogResponse postKey = htmlResponse . blog postKey
```

That's a bit easier to follow, right?

I think next on the roadmap would be to polish up some side projects I've worked on and make it possible to interact with them through the site. I'm not sure if I'll write those pages from scratch, or if I'll expand the capabilities of the markdown to allow some interactivity. At that point it might just be worth it to write html / js / whatever and not make the markdown language too different from regular github-flavored markdown.
