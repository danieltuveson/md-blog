<h1>Howdy world</h1><br>I&#39;ve been working with Haskell for a while now, on and off in my spare time, but I haven&#39;t gotten the chance to do anything really practical with it. So far, I wrote a sudoku solver, a simple programming language for performing basic calculations, and <em>most of</em> a command line chess application (along with about 10 half finished and abandoned projects). So like all imagination-lacking programmers do eventually do, I decided to make a blog backend with it. <br><br>Since I&#39;m not too experienced with web development (in Haskell or anything other language, really), I thought the most fun thing to do would be to make a simple blog backend written mostly from scratch. I&#39;ve tried a few Haskell backend frameworks in the past, but most of them either didn&#39;t build on my machine, were poorly documented, or were overkill for what I want. So I&#39;ve decided to just use WAI / Warp, which are the core libraries used by most Haskell backend frameworks. Even if I decide I want to switch over to one of those frameworks down the line, building some knowledge of WAI / Warp will probably be an asset.<br><br><h2>The Specifications:</h2>All I want is to be able to write markdown and have it show up as a blog post. For that, I&#39;ll need two things:<br><ul><li>Something that can convert markdown to HTML</li><li>Something that can serve that HTML to a reader</li></ul><br><h2>Libraries: </h2>Since I don&#39;t want things to get too complicated, I&#39;m going to go with a couple of simple, fairly well documented libraries.<br><ul><li>WAI / Warp for the server</li><li>Blaze HTML for rendering HTML </li><li>Parsec for converting the markdown to HTML</li><li>Stack for building / managing dependencies</li></ul><br><h2>Step 1: Building The Markdown Parser</h2>I&#39;m going to start by building out the markdown parser. With Parsec, building parsers is pretty straightforward. If you need to build a moderately complex parser or compiiler where performance is not the most important thing in the world, I would strongly consider using Parsec (and if performance matters, Haskell still has many great options). Once you&#39;ve defined the datatypes, you basically write in plain english how you want to parse the code. It&#39;s pretty readable, especially when compared to regex. Want to parse a newline? Write <code>newline</code>. Want to parse some letter in &quot;abc&quot;? Write <code>oneOf &quot;abc&quot;</code>. Want to do some lookahead? Use <code>lookAhead</code> with the thing you want to match. It&#39;s a joy to work with, and the library is practically self-documenting. <br><br>I&#39;ll start by just building out the most basic functionality, so <br><ul><li>Inline styles: <strong>Bolding</strong> / <em>italics</em> / <del>strikethroughs</del> / <code>inline code</code> / <a href="https://daniel-tuveson.herokuapp.com/">links</a>)</li><li>Lists</li><li>Headers</li><li>Code blocks</li></ul><br>I&#39;ll add in functionality for images, tables, and stuff like that later, but for now I just want something to be able to convert this post to HTML and serve it.<br><br><h2>Step 2: Building the backend</h2>This step is going to be pretty simple, since I literally just want to serve a post sitting in a folder. What I&#39;ll do is have the program convert all markdown files to blaze-html bytestrings, then serve those as people request them. <br><br>In the future I may convert this site to a Scotty backend, but for now this site exists as a way for me to play around with the more low level features of a web backend, so I&#39;m going to continue using plain WAI.
